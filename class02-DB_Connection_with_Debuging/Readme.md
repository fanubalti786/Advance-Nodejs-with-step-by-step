# Connecting and Debugging a Database in the MERN Stack
"The process of connecting a database in the MERN stack involves using Mongoose for the connection, handling errors with proper debugging, and setting up environment variables for consistency. Key steps include troubleshooting database import issues, managing connection errors, and ensuring the process exits if needed. The successful connection is confirmed once the database is properly set up with error handling in place."
